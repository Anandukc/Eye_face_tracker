# Eye_face_tracker

Eye Face Tracker is a real-time head pose and blink detection application implemented in Python. It utilizes the MediaPipe library for robust facial landmark detection, enabling accurate tracking of head movements and eye blinks. This application is designed for various use cases, including user interaction, accessibility, and gaze-controlled interfaces. With its ability to recognize head orientation and blinking, Eye Face Tracker provides an intuitive way to interact with devices without traditional input methods.

## Features
Real-time head pose estimation: Accurately determines the user's head orientation (up, down, left, right, forward).
Blink detection: Monitors eye blinks and counts total blinks over time, enhancing user engagement and interaction.
Facial landmark tracking: Identifies and visualizes key facial features, providing insights into user expressions.
Cross-platform compatibility: Built with standard libraries, making it easy to run on various operating systems.
